# Task 01 - Configure essential GitHub Advanced Security settings

## Introduction

Zava would like to ensure developers are being guided to deliver quality and secure code. By leveraging GitHub Enterprise and additional features provided by GitHub Advanced Security, the team can rely on tools to monitor, correct and even prevent security issues. Now that the application is built and deployed, before adding new features you will turn on security features to help with secure coding best practices.

## Description

GitHub Advanced Security provides enterprise-grade security features including secret scanning, dependency vulnerability detection (Dependabot), and static application security testing (CodeQL). In this exercise, you'll configure security settings for your repositories following recommended best practices.

## Success Criteria

- You have enabled your GitHub Advanced Security trial.
- You have created a custom security configuration for the organization and apply to all repositories

## Learning Resources

## Key Tasks

### 01: Enable GitHub Advanced Security trial

Enable the GitHub Advanced Security trial for your organization to access enterprise security features.

### 02: Apply GitHub recommended security configuration

Apply GitHub's recommended security settings to all repositories in your organization as a baseline configuration.

<details markdown="block">

1. In your enterprise settings, navigate to **Security** → **Advanced Security** → **Configurations**

   ![GitHub Advanced Security Settings Menu](../../media/0101_GHAS_settings.png)

2. Apply the GitHub recommended security settings to all repositories by selecting **Apply to all repositories**

### 03: Create custom security configuration

Create a custom security configuration that enhances GitHub's recommended settings with additional security controls tailored to your organization's needs.

2. **Enable AI-Powered Secret Detection**
   - **Name**: `ZavaOrgConfig`
   - **Description**: Default security configuration for Zava organization repositories
   - Under **Secret scanning**, enable **Scan for generic passwords**
   - This helps detect passwords and credentials in the code, even those that might not match standard patterns

3. **Configure Push Protection Bypass**
   - Set **Who can bypass push protection** to **Organization administrators** or a custom high-privilege role
   - This deters bypassing security controls without proper authorization

4. **Require Dismissal Requests**
   - Enable **Prevent direct alert dismissals**
   - This creates an audit trail and supports compliance requirements by documenting all security decisions

   ![Alert Dismissal Requirements](../../media/0101_GHAS_new_config_3.png)

5. **Enable Default Code Scanning**
   - Under **Code scanning**, select **Default** to use GitHub's hosted runners
   - This ensures CodeQL analysis runs automatically on all repositories

   ![Code Scanning Configuration](../../media/0101_GHAS_new_config_4.png)

6. **Configure Dependency scanning**
   - Enable **Automatic dependency submission** to detect vulnerabilities in both direct and transitive dependencies

   ![Dependabot Alerts](../../media/0101_GHAS_new_config_5.png)

7. **Enable Automatic Security Updates**
   - Enable **Security updates**
   - This automatically creates pull requests to fix detected vulnerabilities, reducing manual remediation effort

   ![Automatic Security Updates](../../media/0101_GHAS_new_config_6.png)

8. **Apply to All Repositories**
   - Select **Apply to all repositories** to ensure consistent security across your organization
   - New repositories will automatically inherit these settings

   ![Apply to All Repositories](../../media/0101_GHAS_new_config_7.png)

9. Click **Save configuration** to apply your custom settings, replacing the GitHub recommended configuration

   ![Save Configuration](../../media/0101_GHAS_new_config_8.png)

10. For existing repositories, you may need to manually apply the configuration by selecting **Apply** from the configurations list

### 04: Create branch protection ruleset

Create a branch protection ruleset for your main branch that enforces code quality and review standards across all repositories.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section for detailed steps</strong></summary>

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Rules** → **Rulesets** and click **New ruleset** → **New branch ruleset**

   ![Create New Ruleset](../../media/0101_GHAS_ruleset.png)

2. Configure the ruleset with the following settings:
   - **Name**: `Main Branch Protection`
   - **Enforcement status**: Active
   - **Bypass list**: Organization administrators only (this encourages adherence to rules)
   - **Target repositories**: All repositories
   - **Target branches**: Include default branch

   </details>

3. Configure the following branch protection rules:
   - **Restrict deletions** - Prevent accidental branch deletion
   - **Require a pull request before merging**
     - Require at least **1 approval**
     - Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
     - Require conversation resolution before merging
   - **Block force pushes** - Prevent rewriting history on the main branch
   - **Require status checks to pass** - Block merging when CodeQL or other checks fail
   - **Require code scanning results** - Prevent merging code with security vulnerabilities
   - **Automate Copilot reviews** - Pull requests can be automatically reviewed for code quality by Copilot

   <summary><strong>Expand this section to see a screenshot of the configuration</strong></summary>

   ![Branch Protection Rules](../../media/0101_GHAS_ruleset_2.png)

   </details>

4. Click **Create** to save the ruleset

> **NOTE** These rules enforce a secure development workflow by requiring peer review, preventing dangerous Git operations, and ensuring code quality before merging.

</details>

## Summary

You've completed this task. You have enabled your GitHub Advanced Security trial, created a custom security configuration for the organization, and applied it to all repositories. You have also created a branch protection ruleset.
